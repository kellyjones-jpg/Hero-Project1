# Hop-To-It
Title - "Hop To It" a brewery directory

Proposal/Project Description
Hop To It is an app that a user can interact with to find a Brewery based on their location. The user will have an option to search based on the IP address geolocation, or city. After the user searches, the app will populate a list of Breweries that are nearby. The user can then click on a brewery to get a pop up modal that gives a link to the brewery's website, a link to google maps directions, and a "tap list" generated from the taplist API.

User Story:
